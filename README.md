# A neighborhood explorer for Section 8 voucher holders

This repository contains a Shiny web app designed to assist Section 8 Voucher holders in exploring Philly neighborhoods. The app aggregates data on demographics, amenities, crime rates, and health outcomes alongside the most recent Section 8 rent limit boundaries and contribution expectations.

By integrating these datasets, the app enables users to effectively narrow their housing search by filtering neighborhoods that match:  

- **Program Requirements**: Displays neighborhoods where rent levels comply with Section 8 limits.
- **Personal Preferences**: Allows customization of neighborhood characteristics such as demographics, amenities, safety, and health services, focusing on user-defined preferences.
- **Financial Constraints**: Includes tools to calculate expected contributions and explore feasible rent levels within the userâ€™s voucher.

This tool aims to empower users to make more informed decisions by translating program requirements into plain language and centering individual neighborhood preferences.
